	<h2>Showcase</h2>
	<p>
		INSERT a video showcasing it HERE<br>
		(nothing to really show yet)<br><br>
	</p>

	<h2>Possible future software</h2>
	<p>
		Below are some proposed software ideas that I might create in the future.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Portable HTML Document standard</h3>
	<p>
		An alternative to PDF. <br>
		The difference from regular HTML is that it’s split into pages, and contains all the styling and images in the same file. <br>
		CSS styles can be updated while the file is open. <br>
		An example of a use for this is with e-books. A reader may want to change the font, 
		text size or page colour. <br>
		Also, a user may right-click on an image to save it, 
		as with a regular HTML file. <br>
		Other HTML features such as embedded audio and video can 
		be used in the document.
	</p>
	<h3>New FuzeVD</h3>
	<p>
		Revive the old Fuze video downloader, switching to modern open-source libraries.<br>
		Would be available as a browser extension, Embedding a download button onto videos.
	</p>
	<h3>HTML Formatter</h3>
	<p>
		A simple tool to help in web development.<br>
		<br>
		Bulky web frameworks may not be needed for smaller projects (such as fuze.page).<br>
		However, in HTML pages there are some repeating sections, most commonly a navigation bar.<br>
		With this tool, you could simply write an HTML comment, and it will add a code snippet from another file.
	</p>
	<h3>FuzeBox</h3>
	<p>
		This game is designed to be a sandbox where people can upload
		and share the maps, assets, and even gamemodes they create.<br><br>
		Single or multiplayer games can be hosted.<br><br>
		Theoretically, a <a href="https://diep.io">diep.io</a> clone
		or almost any 2D browser game imaginable could be re-created
		within this engine.<br><br>
		Think of it like a two-dimensional <i>Garry's Mod</i>.<br>
		<b>Update: This project will be postponed until at least the full release of Warren Budget.</b>
